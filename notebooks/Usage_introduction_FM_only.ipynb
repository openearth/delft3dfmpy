    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an overview of the functionalities of the dhydamo module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For install instructions see: https://github.com/openearth/dhydamo#installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the old version of the package (delft3dfmpy) will not be updated anymore and won't be available through GitHub. New features (RR-modelling, additional hydraulic structures, etc.), will be implemented in dhydamo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it should be noted that recently added features were tested with dummy-data, which is included with this package. The generated model is, therefore, not necessarily a correct hydraulic representation, as some dummy structures were added and existing structures moved and/or adjusted. The purpose of this notebook is solely to illustrate the usage of the dhydamo module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is identical to the '_coupled_RRFM' variant, albeit that there is no RR component and all laterals are filled with time series."

    "The following aspects are new compared to the previous version:\n",
    " - culvert length is derived from HyDAMO setting in the GML file instead of the line geometry;\n",
    " - spelling of parametrised is now consistent, i.e., \"dflowfmmodel.paratemeterised\" would now give an error;\n",
    " - pumps now expect their margins in m+NAP instead of cm. I.e., the margins are now used directly to set the start/stoplevelsuctionside. Previously they were related to the 'streefwaarde';\n",
    " - Boundary conditions can be added to the model as 'dfmmodel.external_forcings.io.from_hydamo(hydamo.boundary_conditions)' instead of running 'add_boundary_condition' in a loop. This does not work (yet) for time series, only for constant boundary conditions\n",
    " - structures bridge, universal weir, compound structure and orifice are added. For culverts an 'afsluitmiddel' can be added. If it is 5 (terugslagklep) the flow-direction is set to positive, if it is 4 (schuif), a valve is added.\n",
    " - the module was breaking down when pandas was updated to version 1.0.1. Further updating to 1.0.3 fixes this. It is therefore, recommended to upgrade Pandas to at least 1.0.3. Previous workarounds have been removed again.  \n",
    " - functionality has been implemented to generate also the RR-components of a coupled RR-FM D-HYDRO model.\n",
    " - the old format external-forcingsfile, and assiciated tim-files, are not used anymore. Boundaries, laterals and intial conditions have been updated to the new format, where time series are included in a .bc-file.\n",
    " - MDU file has ben updated to version 1.09\n",
    " - culverts can be combined with 'afsluitmiddel': terugslagklep (flow-direction set to positive) or a valve. The afsluitmiddel points to a culvert using the HyDAMO field 'codegerelateerdobject'.\n",
    " - Orifices can be specificied using a separate input file. It contains a field 'schuifhoogte' and 'maximaaldebiet' to limit discharge. \"Schuifhoogte' can be specified as a timeseries, similar to the kruinhoogte of a weir.\n",
